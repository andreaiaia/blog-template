# blog-template

The template I based my blog on

# TODO

- Add generic logo.svg
- add generic image for markdown sample post
- add generic image for document.js socials previews

- update the structure to be a homepage with all the posts and an about page (remove the homepage or make it optional)
- change the font
- change the color palette
- Create a SEO component to add on top of all the pages

# Deploy your own

With this template you can start blogging in minutes, just click the button below and your blog will be available online at `https://your-blog-name.vercel.app`.

After the deploy make sure you read the [Initial setup](#initial-setup) section to customize the metadata of your blog.

[![Deploy on Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fandreaiaia%2Fblog-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false)

## Initial setup

Once you've deployed your blog on vercel, you need to do some basic setup.

In the file `blog.config.js` you need to change values of the OWNER and BLOG variables, here you can also link the socials you want to display in the footer.

Now you can start writing your posts, you can find them in the `articles` folder, delete the sample post and start writing your own.

To publish a post just **push** the changes to the main branch of your repository, Vercel will automatically deploy the new version of your blog with your new post.
